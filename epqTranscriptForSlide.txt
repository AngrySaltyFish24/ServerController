I have a file server at home that I use to store information like work and to
back up my system. The problem is that for me to access this server I need
the server to be turned on. The obvious solution to this is to keep the server

to access the server for a short period of time meaning I would be wasting electricity
by keeping it always turned on, the server is also very noisy so this is not a good
solution to the problem. A better resolution to this would be to have the ability
to turn the server on and off remotely and this is essentially the aim of this project.

Now that I have a clear aim I would like to break this problem into smaller ones to
help me acheive the characteristics that I want. The first I talk about in the previous
slide and is the main goal of this project. The second one is important as I want to
reduce the cost of running the device as much as possible. The next item
